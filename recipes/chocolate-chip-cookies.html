<h3>Cookie Ingredients</h3>

    </li>
    <li><em>Butter</em> Beat the sugar with two sticks of softened butter.
    </li>
    <li><em>Eggs</em>Two eggs lend moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together. </li>
    <li><em>Vanilla</em>Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chocolate chip cookies. </li>
    <li><em>Flour</em>All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure. </li>
    <li><em>Cocoa powder </em>They wouldnt be chocolate chocolate chip cookies without cocoa powder!</li>
    <li><em>Baking soda</em>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise. </li>
    <li><em>Salt</em>A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it wont make the cookies taste salty.</li>
    <li><em>Chocolate chips</em>You’ll need two cups of semisweet chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
